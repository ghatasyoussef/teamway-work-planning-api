# Overview

The "Work Planning Service" is a REST application built from scratch to serve as a work planning service. The primary focus of this application is to efficiently manage work shifts for workers based on specific business requirements. The application ensures that each worker has shifts, adhering to the defined rules:

Shifts: A worker is assigned shifts, and each shift is precisely 8 hours long.

No Same-Day Overlaps: A worker is guaranteed not to have two shifts on the same day, promoting a balanced and sustainable work schedule.

24-Hour Timetable: The work timetable follows a 24-hour cycle divided into three 8-hour shifts: 0-8, 8-16, 16-24.
